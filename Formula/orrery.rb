    # is idempotent and skips interactive prompts when /dev/tty is
    # unavailable, so it's safe on both fresh install and upgrade.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Activate Orrery in the current shell:

        source ~/.orrery/activate.sh

      New shells pick it up automatically via your rc file.

      To return to your original config at any time:

        orrery use origin

      Upgrading from Orbital? Just run `orrery` — it will auto-move
      ~/.orbital/ to ~/.orrery/ and update your shell rc file on first run.
